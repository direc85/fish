# Fish

Fish is a user-fiendly, interactive shell. This project provides the packaging
of the application (without gettext translations, documentation and
translations) to Sailfish OS.

You'll need `fingerterm`, `toeterm` et. al. to use this. If you have developer
mode enabled, you can also SSH into the device and start it after login.

The packaging is wonky, but seems to work. I included the icons and a hidden
desktop file for completeness sake, but they don't really serve any purpose.

If you're unfamiliar with Fish, please check out the
[Introduction](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#tutorial) or
(Fish for bash users)[https://fishshell.com/docs/current/fish_for_bash_users.html#fish-for-bash-users]
to get started!

Improvements in the packaging are very welcome!

Happy hacking!
